The original punched card coding used by Hollerith allowed coding of only
a limited alphabet; over the years, this was extended in many ways, but
while many of these extensions were upward compatable from the original
code, no attempt to standardize the extensions was successful until the
end of the punched card era.  As a result, keypunch users got quite used
to learning, for example, that &cent; was to be typed when [ was intended.
<P>
The standard punched card had 80 columns, numbered 1 to 80 from left to right.
Each column could hold one character, encoded as some combination of punches
in the 12 rows of the card.  Rows were numbered and grouped as follows:
<PRE WIDTH=70>
                  ____________
                 /
          /  12 / O
  Zone rows  11|   O
          \/  0|    O
          /   1|     O
         /    2|      O
        /     3|       O

          \   8|            O
           \  9|             O
               |______________

There is some ambiguity in the classification and numbering of the 10th
row.  This was either numeric row 0, because it was usually punched to
encode the numeral zero, or it was zone row 10, because it served to mark
one of the three &quot;zones&quot; into which the alphabet was divided.
Punches in rows 8 and 9 also identified distinct zones in some card codes,
although they were not usually described as such.
<P>
In written material on card codes, hyphenation was used to connect the row
numbers punched in one column to encode one character; for example, in most
card codes, a comma was encoded as 0-8-3, or punches in rows 0, 8 and 3 of
one card column.  In this notation, zone punches were always listed first,
and for the triple punch characters involving row 8, this was usually
listed between the zone punch and the numeric punch that distinguished that
character.
<P>
<H2><A NAME=BCD>The Main Line of Development, from BCD to EBCDIC</A></H2>
<P>
The common 6-bit BCD encodings of the 12 columns of a punched card allowed
for 64 distinct punch combinations.  The following illustration shows these
combinations, along with the &quot;consensus code&quot; that was common to
the main line of descendants of Hollerith's coding system:

Holes in 80 column cards were rectangular, not the letter O as shown, and
there was some variation in the coding of the postions shown with ?.
A blank was, of course, always represented by a card column with no holes
punched.
<P>
While there were many 6-bit encodings derived from this punched card code,
most such encodings rested on a 4 bit BCD encoding of the hole punched
in rows 1 to 9, augmented with a 2 bit code indicating the zone punch.
For example, consider the following:
<PRE>
            1 2 3 4 5 6
            ___________
           |_|_|_|_|_|_|
           |   |       |
           Zone Numeric

        set bit    if punch in rows
           1            0 or 12
           2           11 or 12

           3            8 or 9
           4         4, 5, 6 or 7
           5         2, 3, 6 or 7
           6        1, 3, 5, 7 or 9
</PRE>
Note that this particular 6-bit code (used by the
<A HREF="http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~dwjones/pdp8/man/card.html#rcra">
PDP-8 RCRA instruction</A>)
is only an example.  IBM's BCD codes were all more complex, partly because
of a desire to represent the numeral zero with the 6-bit numeric code
000000 (in the IBM 704, 709, 7040 and 7090) or with 001010 (in the IBM 705,
7080, 1401, 1410 and 1414).  This is presumably related to the use of the
12-0 and 11-0 combinations in these machines.

<H3>The IBM model 026 keypunch</H3>
<P>
The IBM model 026 keypunch, introduced in July 1949, was the workhorse of
much early work in business data processing, and although it was
incapable of automatically punching the
large character set required by most programming languages, many model 026
punches remained in use into the early 1970's.  There were at least two common
character sets supported by this punch, one for commercial applications and
one oriented towards the needs of FORTRAN - the difference was in the keycaps
and the characters printed on the cards, not in the holes punched, and many
keypunches produced hybrids of these two character sets!

Later models of the 026 commercial character set frequently substituted
the <TT>&lt;</TT> character for <TT>&curren;</TT> (12-8-4).
<P>
Note that the IBM 026 commercial character set is identified as the BCD-A
character set in
<A HREF="http://www.wins.uva.nl/faculteit/museum/technotes/DWcodes.html">
Dik Winter's collection of collating sequences</A>, and that
the FORTRAN character set is identified as BCD-H.  It is probable that
A stands for Alphameric (an IBMish contraction of Alphanumeric), while
H stands for Hollerith, with reference to FORTRAN's Hollerith encoding
of text strings.
<P>
The IBM 024 keypunch was identical to the 026, except
that it did not
include a printing mechanism.  Formally, the 026 was called a printing
keypunch because of this mechanism.  The 024 had the same keyboard options.
The 024 punch could punch at 80 columns per second (for example, when
duplicating a previously punched card), while the 026 dot-matrix printing
mechanism limited the speed to 18 columns per second.
<P>
The 1963 IBM <I>Student Text</I> for the 7040 and 7044 computers
(Form C22-6732-1) states that the H code is the standard IBM card code
(page 21).  Figure 23 on page 22 gives the following two sets of graphics
for the H code, one for report writing, a superset of the 026 commercial
code, and one for programming languages a superset of the 026 FORTRAN code:

A number of the characters used in the IBM 7040 and 1401 card codes are
misprinted in the above two figures; most of these are defined as control
characters in the 1401 documentation:
<PRE>
	<EM CLASS=S>b</EM> (8-2)    slashed b                      substitute blank
	<EM CLASS=S>V</EM> (8-7)    square root                    tape mark
        &#167; (12-8-7) triple horizontal bar slashed  group mark
        <EM CLASS=U>^</EM> (11-8-7) Greek capital delta            mode change
	&#177; (0-8-2)  not equals                     record mark
	v (0-8-5)  inverted caret or equals       word separator
	&#182; (0-8-7)  triple vertical bar slashed    segment mark
</PRE>
Note that the parentheses in the 1401 character set were frequently printed
as square braces; only in character sets that contain both parentheses and
braces do users care much about the distinction; the BCD code included in
Dik Winter's collection is a hybrid of the 1401 and the 70x commercial
character sets, without the 12-0 and 11-0 multipunches, and with no printable
graphics associated with the control characters.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=029>The IBM model 029 keypunch</A></H3>
<P>
The IBM model 029 keypunch, introduced around 1964, was the most common
keypunch of the late 1960's and early 1970's.  These were found almost
everywhere computers were to be found, and they supported a full 64 printing
characters, with graphics that
represented a compromize between the needs of programmers and commercial
applications.  The closely allied EBCD and IBMEL character sets are also given
here.  While these character sets are sufficient for FORTRAN, they are
upward compatable from the 026 commercial character set and they have a large
degree of compatability with the 70x0 character set (with which they are
compared here):

In the IBMEL character set, the following characters are misprinted:
<PRE>
	&#185; (12)     logical and
	&#178; (8-4)    logical or
	&#179; (0-8-2)  subscript ten
</PRE>
The EBCD and IBMEL character sets come from Dik Winter's collection.  These
were used by Electrologica computers.

<P>
No description of punched card codes would be complete without a description
of the Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) developed for
the IBM System 360.  EBCDIC is a direct descendant of the 6-bit BCD codes
used by IBM's early computers.  One consequence of this is that the EBCDIC
codes for the 029 character set can be truncated to 6 bits, yielding a
perfectly useful 6-bit BCD character set.
<P>
What follows is the usual tabular presentation of the EBCDIC code, where the
labels on the top and left sides of the table give the two digit hexadecimal
code for each table entry, while the labels on the bottom and right sides
give the punched card holes used to encode the entry:

The entries in the above table with footnotes are exceptions to the
punching rules given by the labels at the bottom and right side of
the table.  These are punched as follows:
<OL>
<LI><TT>NUL</TT> -- 12-0-1-8-9
<LI><TT>DS </TT> -- 11-0-1-8-9
<LI><TT>SP </TT> -- no punches
<LI><TT>& </TT> --- 12
<LI><TT>- </TT> --- 11
</OL>
SP is, of course, space.  The other table entries with multiple character
names are control characters, and those with names that match the names of
ASCII control characters serve the same funcitons.  With the modifications
noted, this table gives a punched card encoding that is fully upward
compatable with the IBM 029 code given above.

This version of the EBCDIC table is based on the presentation in Appendix C
of <I>System 360 Programming</I> by Alex Thomas, 1977, Reinhart Press,

<H2>Proprietary 026 variants</H2>
<P>
Given the sparse nature of the IBM 026 character set and the larger character
sets supported by printers of the era, many computer manufacturers developed
proprietary extensions of their own, some with a great degree of compatability
with IBM's later character set extensions, and some with little or no
compatability.  The following collection of character sets have clear
relationships to one or the other IBM 026 code, but no clear relationship to
IBM's later card codes.
<P>
<H3>Control Data Corporation</H3>

Control Data Corporation defined an eccentric version of the BCD character
set that was clearly oriented towards scientific computing.  This is derived
from the 026 FORTRAN character set, augmented with a full set of relational
operators and directional arrows:

Digital Equipment Corporation defined translation tables for both the

<I>1967 PDP-8/L Small Computer Handbook</I> simply defined the DEC 026 code
as equivalent to the IBM 026 Fortran character set and the DEC 029 code as
equivalent to the IBM 026 Commercial character set.
<P>
The later version of these mappings given in the
<I>1972 Small Computer Handbook</I> gives a DEC 029 code that cleanly maps
the IBM 029 character set to the common 6-bit upper-case-only subset of ASCII:

The DEC 026 code is a workable mapping of the IBM 026 FORTRAN character
set to ASCII.  Unfortunately, it appears to have nothing in
common with other extensions of the same character set.  Given the frequency
of typos in DEC's handbooks, it is possible that the problem is with the
handbook from which this material was derived.

In the above, the 0-8-2 punch shown as _ should be printed as an

up-arrow.  This conforms to the evolution of of these ASCII symbols from

<P>
This paper by David M. MacMillan focuses on telegraph and punched tape codes
developed before the connection between permutation codes and binary numbers
was understood by most of the people involved.  In these codes, as with the
punched card codes described here, the codes assigned to alphabetic characters
were not in binary order.  In some cases, the central focus was on minimizing
the total wear on the punches, so common characters were assigned just one
punch each, while uncommon characters punched more holes.  In Baudot's original
code, which was designed to be typed on a "chord keyboard", vowels were punched
with just the right hand, while consonents required both hands.
